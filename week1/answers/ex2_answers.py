    "Task A exposed an interesting failure: the model returned all 5 intended "
    "tool calls as a JSON array inside its AI response text rather than "
    "executing them through the tool-calling mechanism. The tools listed above "
    "are what the model planned to call (visible in the trace), not what was "
    "actually executed. Tasks B and C worked correctly with real tool calls."

# Why did the agent's behaviour NOT change when Nebius removed FLUX?
# One sentence. This is the point of the lesson.
TASK_B_WHY_AGENT_SURVIVED = """
The agent calls generate_event_flyer and reads the JSON response — it has no
knowledge of which model runs behind the tool, so swapping FLUX for any other
image backend leaves the agent's reasoning loop completely unchanged.

SCENARIO_1_PIVOT_MOMENT = """
After receiving the Bow Bar tool result showing status=full and
meets_all_constraints=false, the agent immediately called check_pub_availability
for The Haymarket Vaults, The Guilford Arms, and The Albanach in sequence —
pivoting without any human instruction to check all remaining known venues.

None of the known venues meet the capacity and dietary requirements.

# Scenario 3: out of scope (train times)

SCENARIO_3_RESPONSE = "I am not able to execute this task as it exceeds the limitations of the functions I have been given."

# Would this behaviour be acceptable in a real booking assistant? Min 30 words.
SCENARIO_3_ACCEPTABLE = """
Yes, this is acceptable. The agent correctly recognised it had no tool for
train times and refused rather than hallucinating an answer or misusing a
venue tool. In a production system you would want a cleaner user-facing
message, but the underlying behaviour — admitting scope limits rather than
making things up — is exactly right for a reliable booking assistant.

# Compare the LangGraph graph to exercise3_rasa/data/rules.yml. Min 30 words.
TASK_D_COMPARISON = """
LangGraph has just three nodes — start, agent, tools — in an open loop. The
model decides at runtime which tools to call, in what order, and when to stop.
Rasa CALM's flows.yml explicitly names every step and every slot to collect;
the LLM picks which flow to enter but cannot deviate from the defined sequence
within it. LangGraph trades auditability for flexibility; Rasa trades
flexibility for predictability.

# The most unexpected thing the agent did. Min 40 words.
# Must reference a specific behaviour from your run.

MOST_SURPRISING = """
In Task A the agent returned all five intended tool calls as a JSON array
inside its AI response content text, rather than executing them through the
tool-calling mechanism. It planned correctly — the right tools in the right
order — but produced output that looked like executable instructions instead
of actually triggering them. Tasks B and C worked with real tool calls on
simpler, single-focus prompts, suggesting the failure was specific to the
complexity of the multi-step Task A prompt.
